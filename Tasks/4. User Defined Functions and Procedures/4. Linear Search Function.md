# Linear search function (read carefully!)

Complete your own list of games to search through.

Then, modify the existing function to use a `position` variable, instead of `found`. Check your notes on using a position in a linear search. Instead of returning True or False, the function should now return the position of the game in the list (e.g. 0 if the game is the first item).

#Starter Code
```
# Linear search function
def search_for(list_of_things, target_thing):
  found = False
  for i in range(0, len(list_of_things)):
    if list_of_things[i] == target_thing:
      found = True
  return found
  

# Test the function
games = []
s = search_for(games, "Mass Effect Legendary Edition")
print(s)
```
