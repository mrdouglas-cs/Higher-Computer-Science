# Two Functions

A program contains a list of ten floats (real numbers). Write a program with two functions - one to find the minimum, and one to find the maximum. The functions should accept an array of numbers as a parameter, and each return a value. Test both functions with your list of ten floats.

# Starter Code
```
# First function
def findMin(numbers):
  pass

# Second function
# Write the findMax function here, based on your findMin function

# Test both functions
nums = []
min = findMin(nums)

# Add code to test the findMax function, and print both values
```
