# Count Occurences if Less

Write a program which will count how many numbers in the ```nums``` list are less than the ```target``` which is ```15```.

You will need to add some sample numbers to the ```nums``` list yourself.

# Starter Code
```
# Count occurrences if the target is < the list item
# Use 'if .... < target_number:'
def countLessThan(numbers, target_number):
  pass

# Test the function
nums = []
target = 15
count = countLessThan(nums, target)
print(count, "numbers were less than", target)
```
