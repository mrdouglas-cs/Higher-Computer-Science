# Find minimum (function)

Complete the function (replace `pass`) to find the lowest number in a list of numbers passed in. Return the lowest number at the end of the function.

Complete your own list of appropriate numbers and thoroughly test the function (test it with more than one list, to make sure it works for a range of different minimum numbers).

# Starter Code
```
# Find minimum function
def findMin(list_of_numbers):
  pass

# Test the function
# Define your own list of numbers to test with:
nums = []
min = findMin(nums)
print(min)
```
