# Average of Ten Numbers

A program contains a list of ten numbers [11, 14, 21, 82, 7, 14, 65, 18, 21, 50].
Write a function that takes a list of numbers as a parameter, totals them, calculates the average, and returns the average.

# Starter Code

```
def get_average(numbers):
  # Complete the function with a running total (from N5)
  total = 0
  average = total / len(numbers)
  return average


# Test the function
nums = [11, 14, 21, 82, 7, 14, 65, 18, 21, 50]
avg = get_average(nums)
print(avg)
```
