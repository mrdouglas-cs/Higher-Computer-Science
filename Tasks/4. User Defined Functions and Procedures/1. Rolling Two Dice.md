# Rolling Two Dice (user-def function)

Write a function that represents rolling two dice. The user should call the roll() function, with no parameters needed, and the function should return one of the  random numbers that would be possible if you were to roll two dice in real life.

# Starter Code
```
# Function that generates the result of two random numbers
def RollTwoDice():
  # Complete the function
  pass

# Test the function
dice = RollTwoDice()
print(dice)
```
