# Three Remainder Four... (challenging)

Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters, and divides them.

It should print the result like “5 remainder 3” or “2 remainder 0”.

You will need to use modulus to find the remainder. How do you find the first integer (i.e. the 5 or the 2)? You'll need to use one of the other pre-defined functions (which we have covered!) to round down.

# Starter Code
```
# Function that divides and returns quotient and remainder
def big_divide(num1, num2):
  answer1 = 0
  remainder = 0
  return str(answer1) + " remainder " + str(remainder)


# Test the function with two numbers
div = big_divide(14, 3)
print(div)
```
