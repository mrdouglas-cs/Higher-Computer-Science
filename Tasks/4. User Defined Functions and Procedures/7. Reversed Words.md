# Reversed Words (challenging)

Write a function that asks the user to enter a word. The function should return the reverse - for example, if the user enters “HELLO”, the function should return “OLLEH”.

*Loop through each of the characters, using substring. Add those to a new string, back-to-front...*

---
Then extend the program:
* Add an `isPalindrome(word, rev_word)` function, which takes the word and reversed word, and returns True if both words match, or False if the words don't match.

# Starter Code
```
# Function to reverse a word or phrase
def reverseWord(word):
  pass

# Test the function
word = input("Enter a word:")
rev = reverseWord(word)
print(word, "reversed is", rev)
```
