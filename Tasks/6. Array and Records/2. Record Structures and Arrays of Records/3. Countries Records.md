# Countries Records

# Starter Code
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Country record
@dataclass
class Country:
  name: str
  capital: str
  continent: str
  population_millions: float
  has_coastline: bool

# Declare an array for 200 countries


# Data for the first few countries

```

## Declare the Empty Array
The Country record structure has been completed for you, based on one of the earlier tasks.
 Read the code, and underneath the comment, declare an array that can store data for 200 countries. Call your array `countries_list`.

## Populate the Array
Once you've declared the array, store data for one country at the first position:

```
countries_list[0] = Country("Albania", "Tirana", "Europe", 2.8, True)
```

Quickly look up data for a few other countries, and add code for them too. Don't spend too long on this part - I don't really care about the accuracy! ðŸ¤«


## Countries with a Coast
Let's assume you've got data for five or six countries.

We want the program to count how many countries in the list have a coastline. This will use a count occurrences algorithm, from earlier in the course.

```
# Count occurrences algorithm with array of records

coast_count = 0
for i in range(___):
  if countries_list[i].has_coastline:
    coast_count = coast_count + 1
    
print(coast_count, "countries have a coast.")
```

Try the code above, then adapt it underneath, as follows:

1. Count how many countries have a population under 3 million
2. Count how many countries are in Europe
3. Find the country with the highest population (use a find max algorithm)
4. Find the country with the lowest population _in Europe_ (from your list).

## Linear Search
Add code that asks the user to enter the name of a country:
```
target_country = input("Enter name of a country:")
```
Do a linear search with the `countries_list`, to find where `countries_list[i].name == target_country`. Also, when found, print whether this country has a coastline:
```
found = False
for i in range(___):
  if countries_list[i].name == target_country:
    found = True
    print(countries_list[i].has_coastline)
    
```
Try the code above, then adapt it to show the country's population as well.

Once you have this working, add **a second linear search algorithm** that asks for the name of a continent, and prints the name and population of all countries on that continent.
```
target_continent = input("Enter a continent:")
...
...
...
```

Remember to invite me when you're done.
