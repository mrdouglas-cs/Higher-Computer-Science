# Car Records

This program should store data about five cars. It would be more, but I don't want you to type them all in one-by-one!

# Starter Code
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Car record structure (you should complete)
@dataclass
class Car:
  registration: str

# Array for five cars
cars_list = [Car("")] * 5
```

## Complete the Record Structure
First, complete the record structure. The car record should store each car's registration, make, model, and mileage. Select appropriate data types.

## Create five Records
Later, we'll learn to import the data from a file. Until then, we'll manually enter the data for each car. We already have the empty array that can store five cars:

```
cars_list = [Car("", "", "", 0)] * 5
```
Now, add the following code undeneath to populate the first position in the array with data for one car:

```
cars_list[0] = Car("SP63 AZY", "Ford", "Focus", 10531)
```
Once you're done, this add data for your own for `cars_list[1]`, `cars_list[2]`, etc. (from 0 to 4).

## Traversing the Array
We can traverse the array, to print the data in each record.
It's similar, but not identical, to printing data from parallel arrays.

First, add a loop that repeats 5 times:
```
for i in range(5):
  print(cars[i].registration)
  print(cars[i].mileage)
```
What output would you expect from the above program? Make a note in your jotter or a text file, then enter and run the code to test your prediction.

Once this program works, try modify it to produce output in a sentence, so it says something like "SP63 AZY is a Ford Focus, and it's done 10531 miles." The program should print a similar sentence for each car in the array/loop.
