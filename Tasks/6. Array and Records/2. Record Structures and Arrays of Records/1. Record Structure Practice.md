# Record Structure (@dataclass) Practice

# Starter Code
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Record structure for a Product
@dataclass
class Product:
  id: int
  name: str
  price: float
  packaging: str
  children: bool

# Declare an empty array of 100 products
# Note how I've used the class name, Product
products_list = [Product(0, "", 0.0, "", Flase)] * 100

# Your code goes here
# Use .append to add new values into the products_list

```

This program already contains code for a product record structure. Each product has an id, name, price, packaging type, and whether it is suitable for children (True/False).

Underneath the record structure, there's code that declares an empty array for 100 products.

Read the existing code carefully, and add your own record structures and arrays underneath the comment:

## Games Record Structure
1. Define a record structure called Game. Each game should have a title, studio, the year it was released, whether it's on Xbox (True/False), and whether it's on Playstation (True/False).
2. Declare an empty array that can store data for 50 games.

## Countries Record Structure
1. Define a record structure called Country. Each country should have a name, capital city, which continent it's on, its population, and whether it has a coastline (True/False).
2. Declare an empty array that can store data for 200 countries.

## Flights Record Structure
1. Define a record structure for a passenger flight between airports. It should have a flight number, which is a mix of letters and numbers, and it should have a takeoff airport, a destination, the number of passengers onboard, and the airline name.
2. Declare an empty array that can store data for 1000 flights.
