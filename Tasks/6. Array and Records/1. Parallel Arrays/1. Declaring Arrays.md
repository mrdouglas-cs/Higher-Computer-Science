# Parallel Arrays Practice

This program already contains arrays for five players, with a name and a score (five names, five scores). Practice declaring more parallel arrays below:

# Starter Code

```
# Five player names and their scores
players = ["bob", "jim", "ps5betterthanxbox", "banhammer" "mrdouglasisbestcomputingteacher"]
scores = [10, -15, 300, 27, 891]

# Put your arrays here
```

## Towns
Declare an array of town_names, and an array of populations. Add data for five towns: Hamilton, Glasgow, Blantyre, Edinburgh and Strathaven, and look up their populations online.

```
town_names = [...]
populations = [...]
```

## Classmates
Declare two parallel arrays for six names, and five ages, and populate them with data about your friends in the class or outside of class. Parallel arrays dont' have to come in twos! Add a third and fourth array, with _school-appropriate_ attributes of your choice (e.g. favourite colour, height, whatever...)

```
names = [...]
ages = [...]
attribute3 = [...]
attribute4 = [...]
```

### Traversing parallel arrays
Once you've got your four arrays, add a loop that repeats five times:

```
for i in range(5):
  print(names[i])
  print(ages[i])
```

Now change the code inside the loop, to print a sentence about each person. For example, "Fraser is 33. His favourite colour is blue. His height is [redacted]..."
