# Parallel Arrays Practice

This program is setup with 3 parallel arrays. The arrays store information about different people. The person with the name Bob, is 20 years old and 182.5cm tall. The concept of parallel arrays is, the values are stored in order such that a value at position 0 in the names array, is synced to belong with the values at position 0 in the ages and heights array.

Using the starter code below, write a program to:

- Loop 5 times and write a sentence of output about each person
- For example your output could look like: Bob is 20. He is 182.5cm tall.

# Starter Code

```
# Parallel Arrays
names = ["Bob", "Kirk", "Amy", "Jane", "John"]
ages = [20, 13, 42, 26, 27]
heights = [182.5, 179.0, 155.23, 185.9, 167.3]

# Loop 5 times and write a sentence of output about each person
# For example your output could look like:
# Bob is 20. He is 182.5cm tall.
```
