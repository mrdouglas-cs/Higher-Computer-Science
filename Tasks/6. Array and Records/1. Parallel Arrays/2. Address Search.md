# Address Search (parallel arrays)

The program has two arrays - names and addresses.

They each have eight items.

Complete the program using a linear search algorithm.

# Starter Code
```
# Parallel arrays with eight names and addresses
names = ["Bob", "Amy", "Sarah", "Michael", "Kristen", "Joseph", "Luke", "Angela"]
addresses = ["123 Fake Street", "12 Array Road", "43 Elm Street", "42 Evergreen Terrace", "18 Farm Drive", "19 Olive Avenue", "34 Miracle Street", "128 Bit Road"]

# Linear search to find person's address
```

**Check the linear search algorithm notes, before continuing if you are unsure.**

1. Set position to -1
2. Ask the user to enter a name
3. Loop through each of the names
4. Inside the loop, check if each name is then one you're searching for
5. Inside the if, update the position

After the loop, display the *address* at position. Instead of printing/returning addresses[0], try addresses[position]. Check if they match, e.g. Luke should be found at 34 Miracle Street.
