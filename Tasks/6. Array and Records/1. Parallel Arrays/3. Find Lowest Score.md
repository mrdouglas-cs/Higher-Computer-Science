# Lowest score (parallel arrays)

This program has two parallel arrays.

# Starter Code
```
# Players and scores
players = ["Jimbob", "Mike", "Miri", "Tulula", "Anthony", "Scott", "Skipper", "Darren"]
scores = [33, 11, 29, 102, 18, 14, 67, 18]

# Module to find name of player with highest score
def findHighestName(players, scores):
  position = 0
  for i in range(0, len(scores)):
    # Update position if higher than existing high score
    if scores[i] > scores[position]:
      # Update position
      position = i
  # Return their *name* (the string)
  return players[position]


# Main algorithm
highest = findHighestName(players, scores)
print(highest, "got the highest score")

```

It already has a module (and part of the main algorithm) to find the highest score. Run the program, and check its output. Change some of the names/scores, to confirm that it's working correctly.

Now, add another module to find the lowest score. Use your knowledge of find min/max, and the existing module, to help you.
