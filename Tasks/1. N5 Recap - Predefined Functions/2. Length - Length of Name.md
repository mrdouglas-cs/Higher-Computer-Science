# N5-H Recap - Length of Name

Write a program that asks the user the length of their name. It should reply with "There are ___ letters in your name".

To scaffold this, I've given you some of the code below. Fill in any blanks, and put the code in the right order.

`length_of_name = len(name)`

`____ = input("Enter your name:")`

`print("There are", ___, "letters in your name")`

.

Extension task:

If there are 4 or fewer letters in their name, add a print statement to say "that's a short name".
