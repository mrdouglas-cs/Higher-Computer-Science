# N5-H Recap - High/Low Number

Write a program that asks the user for a high number, and a low number. The program should display a random number between those two values.

I've already added some incomplete code to the program for you to work with.

Use your notes if you don't remember how to use random numbers. The usual code, for a random integer between 5 and 10, would be something like:

```
import random
my_random = random.randint(5, 10)
```

---

# Starter Code

```
# Show a random number between two high/low
import random

high_num =
low_num =

random_num = random.randint(    )

print()

```

---


Remember to display the random number at the end, with a suitable message.

---
Further tasks/modifications:

* Add an `if` statement; if the random number is greater than 9, print a message saying "Your number has at least two digits."
* Change the program so that it generates **five different** random numbers using a loop (something like `for i in range( ):`)
