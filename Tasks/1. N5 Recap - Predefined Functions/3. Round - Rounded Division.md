# N5-H Recap - Rounded Division

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. It should divide the first number by the second number, and show the result rounded to two decimal places.

Some of the code you need is below, but not in order:

`num1 = float(input("Enter the first number:"))`

`rounded_num = round(div_num, 2)`

`print("Answer rounded to 2 decimal places:", rounded_num)`

`num2 = [...fill in this blank...]`

`div_num = num1 / num2`

---

Further tasks/modifications:
* Change the program to round to a different number of decimal places
* Change the program only to accept integers instead of floats
* Change the program to ask for a third number, and divide the first by the second, then divide that by the third, before rounding/printing
