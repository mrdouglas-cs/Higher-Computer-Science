# Count Test Marks (count occurrences)

A school data program contains the percentage results for a class test, represented as an array of integers.

Write a program that counts how many of the scores pass (are 50% or more).

# Starter Code

```
# Set up array of scores
scores = [20, 64, 15, 19, 29, 82, 71, 11, 99, 48]

count_fifty = 0

# Loop through every score in the list

  # Inside the loop, check if each score is >= 50
  # If it is 50 or more, add 1 to the count_fifty variable

# At the end of the program, print message

```

I have already set up the list of scores:

`scores = [20, 64, 15, 19, 29, 82, 71, 11, 99, 48]`

The program should loop through every score.

Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if each score is 50 or more (e.g. `if scores[i]` or `if scores[counter]`).

When the score is >= 50, add 1 to the counter variable:

`count_fifty = count_fifty + 1`

At the end of the program, show a message like "5 people got 50 or more".

Additional tasks/modifications:
* Add another count variable, and another if statement inside the loop, to count how many people got an A (70 or more). The program should count both passes (>= 50) and As (>= 70).
