```

The software for an online game records the names of players, and how many hours they played for. The program starts with two arrays, both with the same number of items:

`players = [ ... ]`

`hours_played = [ ...]`

---
#### Task 1 - Linear search
Add code that asks the user to enter a name to search for:

`search_name = input("Enter name to search for:")`

Complete the first section of code using the linear search algorithm (you should look at your notes!) Inside the loop, check if each name in the list, `players[i]` equals `search_name`.

Display an appropriate message at the end of the program, to say whether the player name was found.

---
#### Task 2 - Find maximum hours
Use the find max algorithm to find the most hours played.

The first part of the algorithm is done for you - setting `maximum` to the first value in the array:

`maximum = hours_played[0]`

Now following the find max algorithm:
* Loop for each item in the array of `hours_played`
* Inside the loop, check if `hours_played[i]` is more than the `maximum` found so far (`if hours_played[i] > maximum`)
* If so, update `maximum` to the new value of `hours_played[i]`, i.e. the highest found so far

At the end of the program, add an appropriate message to show the highest number of hours anyone has played.

---
Additional tasks/modifications:
* The current algorithm says what the highest number of hours was (i.e. 6412), but it doesn't say who played those hours. Add a new variable for `longest_player`. When the program updates `maximum`, also set the `longest_player` to the name of the player at that number in the list (e.g. player cod63).
