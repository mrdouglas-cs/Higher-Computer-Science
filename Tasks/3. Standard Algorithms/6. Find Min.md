# F1 Racing Drivers (find min/max)

# Starter Code
```
# List of drivers and times
drivers = ["Hamilton", "Vettel", "Alonso", "Russell", "Norris"]
times = [101.49, 102.81, 99.58, 110.78, 100.04]

# Find fastest (lowest) lap time

```

This program has two arrays:

`drivers = [ ... ]`

`times = [ ... ]`

The arrays show each driver's name and fictional lap time in seconds.

---
Use the *find min* algorithm to find the shortest lap time. You can refer back to your notes to find specific code:
* Set `min` to the first item in the list
* Loop the correct number of times
* Check if each value is less than existing `min`
* If so, set `min` to the current time value

At the end of the program, add an appropriate message to show the fastest time.

---
The program currently shows the fastest driver's time, but I'd like to modify it to show the *name* of the fastest driver.

Read the following code:
```
min = times[0]
fastest_drv = drivers[0]
for i in range(0, len(times)):
  if times[i] < min:
    min = times[i]
    fastest_drv = drivers[i]
```

This adds a `fastest_drv` variable that will hold the name of the fastest driver. When the if statement finds that `times[i]` is less then `min`, it updates `min` to the time it's currently looking at (i); it *also* updates the `fastest_drv` variable, and sets it to driver i (e.g. if i is 3, driver 3).

---
Additional tasks/modifications:
* Add another section to the program that finds the slowest (highest) time using *find max*. The program should display the names and times of the fastest and slowest drivers together.
* Add a linear search. Ask the user to enter a driver name, then loop through (search) the list of names, and show that driver's *time*. When you find the matching name, use the loop counter variable to look up the corresponding time (i.e. `drivers[counter]` would match `times[counter]`).
* Revisit the running total algorithm from N5. Add a section to the program that adds up a running total as it loops through the times, then divide by the number of times, and display the average time.
