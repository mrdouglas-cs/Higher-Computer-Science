# Baby Names (linear search, count occ.)


# Starter Code
```
# Random sample of baby names
names = ["Jack", "Isla", "Noah", "Olivia", "James", "Emily", "Leo", "Freya", "Oliver", "Ava", "Isla", "Harris", "Jack", "Emily", "Leo", "Jack", "Olivia", "Emily"]

# Linear search and count occurrences
found = False
counter = 0

# Enter name to search for

# Loop for each name
for i in range (0, len(names)):
  
```

This program contains a list of baby names, for all babies born in Scotland in 2019-20. I want to find out:
* If a name is in the list (linear search)
* How many times a name appears (count occurrences)

---
### Task 1 - Linear search
Complete the program so that it asks the user to enter a name. The program should check the list and, if the name is found, set the `found` variable to True. At the end of the program, show a message saying whether the name was found. Test your program with several names (both found and not-found).

---
### Task 2 - Count occurrences
Modify the program so that, as well as checking if the name exists, it counts how many times it appears. Inside the same loop, where the name matches, add 1 to the `counter` variable. At the end of the program, show a message that says how many times the name was counted.

---
Additional tasks/modifications:
* Use if/else to add a more user-friendly message. If the name was found (also works if `counter` > 1) show a message saying how many times it was found. However, if the name was not found (if `counter == 0`), print a different message that says "The name was not found".
