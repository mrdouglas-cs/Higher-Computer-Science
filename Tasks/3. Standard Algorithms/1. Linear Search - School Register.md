# School Register (linear search)

A school register contains a list of names. Write a program that asks the teacher to enter a name, and reports whether or not the person was found in the list.

# Starter Code
```
# Set up list of names
names = ["James", "Robert", "Sarah", "Amy", "John", "Laura", "Aiden", "Stewart", "Jack", "Ciara"]
found = False

# Ask user to enter search_name


# Loop through each name (loop 10 times, or loop for len(names))
  # Inside the loop, check if search_name equals the name in the list
  # If it does, set found to True


# At the end of the program, if found is still True, the name was in the list. Print a message to say whether or not they were found.
```

I have already added this code, which sets up the array of 10 names:


`names = ["James", "Robert", "Sarah", "Amy", "John", "Laura", "Aiden", "Stewart", "Jack", "Ciara"]`

The linear search algorithm works like this:

1. Set `found` to False
2. Enter value to search for
2. Loop for the number of items in the list
3. If each item equals the value you're searching for...
4. -- Set `found` to True

We have a list of something, we loop through each item in the list, and we check if the item at that point in the list is the one we're searching for.

Complete the program, using the comments to help you. Get input from the user (`search_name`). Loop 10 times, and inside the loop, use `if` to check if `search_name` equals `names[`counter`]`.

---
Additional tasks/modifications:
* A more advanced linear search algorithm replaces `found` with `position`. Instead of `found = False`, change to `position = -1`. Inside the if statement, when the item is found, set `position` to store the value of the loop counter, e.g. `position = counter` or `position = i`. At the end of the program, `position` tells you where in the list the item was found (e.g. if it was found as the fifth name, or the first, or not at all...)
