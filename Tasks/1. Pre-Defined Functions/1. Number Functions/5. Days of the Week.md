# Days of the Week (%)

This program uses modulus to cycle through the days of the week.

I have already added an array of five strings (Mon-Fri) and an integer variable called `day_num`. The program will loop *forever* using `while True:` This is a conditional loop, but runs forever (because the condition is always true). Each time the loop runs, it adds 1 to the variable `day_num`. It should show the days of the week in order, one at a time.

---
Run the program and see what happens. Try to predict/explain why there is an error when it runs. Add a comment # with your answer to the start of the program.

---
Add code to the program that checks, inside the loop, if `day_num` can be divided by five. For example:

`if day_num % 5 == 0:`

The `if` statement will be true for every *fifth* time the loop runs. It will be true when `day_num` equals 5, 10, 15, etc.

At the moment, the program crashes when it tries to find `days[5]`, because the array only goes from 0 (Monday) to 4 (Friday). We need to reset the `day_num` counter for every fifth value. Add the following code inside the `if` statement:

`day_num = 0`

Test the program again. It should cycle through the days of the week forever, e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ...

Additional tasks/changes:
* Change the program to work for Saturday and Sunday as well. Think about *all* the changes you will need to make to the program (it isn't just one line).
* Write a new program that works in the same way. Instead of the days of the week, that program should loop through North, South, East and West.
