# Multiples of Five

Complete this program using the code I've given you.

The program currently loops three times, and asks the user for a number, which it stores in an array/list.

* Modify the program to loop ten times, instead of three
* If the number divides by five, show a message saying this is a multiple of five; otherwise, show a message saying that it is not a multiple of five
* Add a line of code that stores the number they entered in the array/list (something like `nums[i] = n`)

---
Further tasks/modifications:
* Change the program to work with random numbers. Add another loop (`for x in range(  )...`) at the start of the program, and use it to generate ten random numbers. Store the random numbers in the array/list (e.g. `nums[i] = my_random_num`). You can delete the line of code that asks the user for input.
