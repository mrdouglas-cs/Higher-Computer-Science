# Odd or Even (%)
Write a program that uses modulus (%) to check for an odd or even number. The program should:

1. Ask the user to enter a number
2. Get the remainder when this number is divided by 2
3. If the remainder is 0, print a message saying that the number is even
4. Otherwise, print a message saying that the number must be odd

---
Try to work out the program on your own, but if you need help, use the scaffolding below - it has some code that you will need, but not in order:

`print("This is an even number")`

`if remainder == 0:`

`else:`

`remainder = num % 2`

---
Further tasks/changes:

* This method could be used to check if a number divides by any other number (not just 2). Modify the program to check for multiples of three. After checking for the odd/even number, add another `if` statement that prints a message stating whether this number is a multiple of 3.
* Replace the user input with a random number between 1 and 100. Print the random number, then print whether it is odd/even, as above.
