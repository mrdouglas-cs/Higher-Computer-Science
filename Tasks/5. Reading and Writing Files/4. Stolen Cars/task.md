# Stolen Cars

The Police National Computer system reads a list of stolen car registrations from a text file, one per line.

Write a program that reads the file. It asks the user to enter a registration, and searches the list to find its position (if present). The program should display either the position, or "not found".

# Starter Code
```
# Read cars from file
def readCars():
  pass

# Get user to enter a valid registration. Do input validation to make sure it's 8 characters long.
def getRegistration():
  pass

# Search for registration
def searchRegistration(cars, registration):
  pass
```
