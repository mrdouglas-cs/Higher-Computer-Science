My favourite subject is computing.
Oak is strong and also gives shade
cats and dogs each hate the other?
The pipe began to rust while new!
Open the crate but don't break the glass.
add the sum to the product of these three.
thieves who rob friends deserve jail.
Act on these orders with great speed!
The hog crawled under the high fence.
Move the vat over the hot fire
Are you enjoying programming?
Mr McKay is my favouritest teacher ever.
The small pup gnawed a hole in the sock.
the fish twisted and turned on the bent hook
Press the pants and sew a button on the vest.
The swan dive was far short of perfect
Two blue fish swam in the tank!
The colt reared and threw the tall rider.
It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning?
Read verse out loud for pleasure
