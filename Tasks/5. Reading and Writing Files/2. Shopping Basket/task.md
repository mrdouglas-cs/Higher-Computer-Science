# Shopping Basket 🛒

A customer’s shopping basket for an e-commerce site is stored in a text file, one item per line.
Write a program that reads the items into an array, and counts how many times “bananas” occurs.

Steps/modules needed:

1. Read the list of items from a file
2. Count the number of times 'bannanas' is in the list
3. Display the number of bannanas


# Starter Code
```
# Read from file
def readBasket():
  pass

# Count occurrences
def countBananas(items):
  pass

# Display results
def showCount(bananas):
  pass

# Main algorithm
```
