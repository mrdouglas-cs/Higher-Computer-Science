# Message Breakdown

Write a program that asks the user to enter a message. The program should loop through the characters one at a time, and output their ASCII values. For example, HELLO becomes 72 69 76 76 79.

This program will need both substrings (to get each letter, one at a time) *and* the ASCII/character functions.

There is some suggested code below, but it isn't in the right order:

```
# Break a message down into ASCII nums

msg = input("Enter message:")

# Loop for the length of the messaage
for i in range(0, len(msg)):

# Get one character at a time (character at position i to position i+1)
char = msg[i:i+1]
```

```
# Convert the character to an ASCII/Unicode number and display
num = ord(char)
print(num)
```

---
Additional tasks/modifications:
* Modify the program to display the character *and* its ASCII code on the same line, e.g. H 72, E 69, L 76, ...
You may need to convert the ASCII number using `str()` if you try to concatenate an integer and a string.
