# Username Generator

A company computer network gives staff a username based on their surname, first initial, and a random 2-digit number (i.e. between 10 and 99).

For example, an employee with the name John Smith could have the username `SmithJ47`.

Write a program that asks the user for two names, and generates a random number. The program should then put it together, and display their username.

You should refer to the code you used for the previous program.

Add the strings together (concatenate), rather than printing with commas between them. For example, use: `username = surname + first_initial + str(random_num)` and `print(username)`.

Instead of:
`print(surname, first_initial, str(random_num))`
