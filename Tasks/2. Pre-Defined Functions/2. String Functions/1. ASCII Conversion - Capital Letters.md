# Capital Letters check

ASCII and Unicode use numbers to represent each character. The letters A-Z correspond to ASCII numbers 65 to 90.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a single character. The program should check if it's a capital letter, using a function to convert the character to its ASCII number, and checking if the number is within the capital letter range.

Use input validation to ask until the user enters a capital letter. *You might want to look at your input validation algorithm from N5.*

1. Ask the user to enter a character
2. Get the ASCII value of the character they entered
3. While the character is not between 65 and  90
4. Show a message, and prompt them to enter it again

Additional tasks/modifications:
* Test what happens when you enter a string of more than one character, but starting with a capital letter (e.g. Hello). Does it still work? Modify the program to also check that the length of the input is exactly one character, using `len()` from N5.
