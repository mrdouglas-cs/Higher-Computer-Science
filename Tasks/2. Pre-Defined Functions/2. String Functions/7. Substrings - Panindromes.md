# Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word that is the same backwards as forwards, e.g. civic, radar, level.

---

Write a program that asks the user for a word or phrase. Loop through the characters one letter at a time (using substring), and make a new string, reversing the order of the letters.

Check if the two strings are the same, to confirm whether the word is a palindrome.

To reverse the order of the string (test this with `print()`):

1. Set up a blank string to hold the reversed letters
2. Loop for the length of the main string
3. Get one character at a time (`substring = big_string[counter:counter+1]`)
4. Add the character to the start of the reversed string (`reversed = substring + reversed`)

I'd suggest printing the reversed string at this point, to test that your algorithm works.

Now use an if statement to check if the original string and the reversed string match. If they are the same, the word/phrase is the same backwards as it is forwards, so the user must have entered a palindrome!

Additional tasks/modifications:
* This part is hard, so don't spend a lot of time on it unless you've already completed the other tasks...
* Can the program be modified to work for an array of possible palindromes? The user would enter a number (e.g. 3), and the program would ask for that many inputs. The palindrome algorithm would then be run on each possible palindrome in the list.
* There is a second solution to this problem, involving looping from both ends of a string. You would compare the first character (character i) to the last character (length - i). If they match, you repeat the loop, and check character 2 and character length-2. If, at any point, you find a mismatch, you know that the string can't be a palindrome. This can be more programmatically efficient, especially on a very long string, as it weeds out some non-palindromes early, without having to test the entire string. Try to implement something like this. You can find descriptions of this algorithm online, and I can also put you on the right track - ask!
