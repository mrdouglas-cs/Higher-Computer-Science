# Starter Code
```
# Read names and ages from the file
# IN:  --
# OUT: names[], ages[]
def read_data():
  pass

# Function to find the average age
# Add all ages together, and divide
# IN:  ages[]
# OUT: average_age
def find_average(ages):
  pass

# Function to find the oldest person's name
# Use find-min/max, then return the name at that position. If you're stuck, just return the oldest age, for fewer marks.
# IN:  names[], ages[]
# OUT: oldest_name
def find_oldest_name():
  pass

# Main algorithm goes here

```
